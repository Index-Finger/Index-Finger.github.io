    <p> Dandelions written and performed by Clayton Valli

        <br>My Target Translation
        <br>Yellow flowers,
        <br>Arrayed in grasses,
        <br>Sway in winds.
        <br>Bitter men come
        <br>With terrible fury see
        <br>Dainty dandelions.
        <br>Ripping, tugging,
        <br>Clear cutting life,
        <br>Till everywhere, green.
        <br>Rain salves, sun soothes,
        <br>Warming the ground till
        <br>Burgeoning life inhales.
        <br>It looks around and,
        <br>Blooms,
        <br>Yellow flower.
        <br>Delicate bees bobble in, pollinate.
        <br> Flowers sway in winds.
        <br>With night they fall away,
        <br>with morning they rise,
        <br>again and again, till,
        <br>Puff! They pop, white,
        <br>And sway in the wind:
        <br>Flower flags.
        <br>Bitter men come,
        <br>“there!”
        <br>Peaceful flowers,
        <br>Sway in winds.
        <br>Hands rip,
        <br>Flowers pop
        <br>And spread.

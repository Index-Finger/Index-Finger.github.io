    <p>Oh thanks! Just needed someone to click that link and make sure it worked. Here's the first small section of Lost Package.</p>

        Oh, it is hot today, Rachel said. She pushed open her screen door and stepped out on her front porch. The glass of cool root beer in her hand started to sweat the second she left the comfort of the indoors. It’s still morning, Rachel thought to herself. How can it possibly be this hot already? The oak trees in her front yard seemed bleached by the white sun. The grass was scorched. The nearest neighboring house, a quarter mile down the lane, glowed. The tin roof and white clapboards reflected so much warmth it was surprising the owners even bothered to install an AC unit.

            She sat down on the wicker chair her dad had made her when she was in college. One of the arms had fraid so much it couldn’t hold any wait. Pieces of reed stuck out every which way and she could see right through it. Amazing that the chair was so sturdy with no base to it. I guess it is already falling apart though, Rachel thought. Maybe I should call dad up to get it fixed.

            While contemplating going back inside, hiding from the heat, Rachel saw a cloud of dust coming from the end of the lane. She sipped her root beer and did her best to look cool. She watched as the mail truck rounded the corner of her driveway, sliding a foot and a half on the transition from gravel road to dirt path. Rachel stood and walked down her front stairs, nearly leaning on the mailbox but reeling back just in time to save her a bad burn.

            Morning Panow, called the mailperson. Surprised to see you awake this early on a Sunday. Market need some help this morning?

            No Jasmine, said Rachel. Got some melatonin. Slept like a baby. Why are you delivering packages on a Sunday?
        </p>
        <p id="breaker"></p>
        <p>
            Rush delivery, said Jasmine, someone’s gotta get Princess Panow her trinkets. Jasmine handed Rachel a white and red USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail box, about a foot wide and tall, 3 inches deep. I’ve gotta get home and feed the chicks. I’ll see you Wednesday?
        </p>
        <p id="breaker"></p>
        <p>
            Yeah see you Wednesday. Bye Jasmine, said Rachel. They had both already turned, wanting to get out of the sun as soon as possible. Rachel returned to her drink and her wicker chair. As she sipped, the root beer fizzed and slowly warmed up. By the time she finished it was noon and she was sticky with sweat.

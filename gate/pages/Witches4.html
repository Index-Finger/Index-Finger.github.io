        -Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Perulo. I have a couple of questions about my documentary that I would like to ask you. First off, what does Witches day mean to you?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Well, it’s all about the town, is it not? Witch day is a celebration of old Spring. The beautiful folks of our community organize a charming party to celebrate the town’s history. The witches come through to help in that revelry, and for that, we should be grateful to them. 
        I am putting forth, to be approved by the council of course, for the renaming of the celebration to Cold Spring Innovator’s day. After all, who are we really celebrating? The witches? They come into our town once a year and pay us no mind whatsoever. I love the witches as much as anybody but I just get to thinking sometimes, as any good mayor would. What have the witches ever done for us?

        -What abou-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Now I know, I know: witches support the local tourism trade. Our cavern is top-notch! It supports almost a quarter of the town and the witches help keep the crowds coming in. But ever since covid, the massive hit to tourism, and many in the town getting laid off, should we not have something a little more stable to affix our sturdy and beloved community to? The witches are just transitory.
        In the grand scheme of things, what do they actually contribute? We already have Halloween, why do we need another holiday based on outdated rituals?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Cold Spring Innovator’s day will emphasize the prized brains of our community. Plus, it will give a great landing platform to a few innovative firms considering using beautiful Cold Spring as a headquarters. I believe, as elected officials of the people of Cold Spring, in the growth and prosperity offered by these firms. And I have more faith in them than I ever had in a pair of quarreling, dangerous witches who raid our town every 200 days. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        That is why, with the approval of the council, of course, I am helping sponsor an innovator's day effort to trap the witches that besiege our town. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Mr. Mayor! You are making a witch trap? That is fantastic news! What is your idea?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Our innovation team has done a marvelous job this year. They, in front of some stakeholders from various firms, will demonstrate the essential know-how of Cold Springers. I, of course, will be cutting the ribbon and pulling the string. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -But what is the actual trap?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        It is a simple and clever piece of innovation! You will see it, along with the rest of Cold Spring, later tonight. Now, I have an 11 am lunch I cannot be late for.

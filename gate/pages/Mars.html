    <p>Call me Mars, like you have always called me: a distant red planet, visible even in the most light polluted of your cities. </p>
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        <p>Call me Mars, not Earth II, or salvation, or Terra Firma, or Redevelopment Zone Alpha. </p>
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        <p>Call me Mars, like the location printed on the great water condensers you have scattered along my surface: everyday pumping out carbon, changing my body and my temperament, to the way you want me to be. </p>
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        <p>Call me Mars, killer of mortals, causer of wars and hardships. Call me that because I will kill everyone you send to land on my body. I will kill the waves of colonists until you have changed me so drastically that I am no longer able. </p>
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        <p>Call me Mars, because I am fading and it will be your last time to address me. It will be your last time to look up, even in your light polluted cities, and see me, burning and red. </p>
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        <p>Call me Mars before you drop your metal cities on me, before you sow your verdant greens into my hide.</p>
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        <p>Call me Mars once more, before it is a lie. </p>

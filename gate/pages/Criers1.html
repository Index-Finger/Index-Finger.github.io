        Theo, as ever, looked ahead. Past his donkey’s brown ears was a path gently curving between two uneven lines of trees . He could not yet see or hear the village of Meriadoc, his destination for the night, but his memory told him that it was not far. 
<br/>
        “Mohenaughh” cooed Theo’s passenger, asleep atop Theo’s other charges, bundles of iron tools and leather straps. He did not turn to look. If he had, he would have seen the blonde boy, feigning sleep, and peeking inside the burlap sacks. The boy’s hands constantly sought the most valuable items within their vicinity. Had Theo turnedlooked, he also would have seen a silver “T” blazoned on each of the boy’s fingers. But Theo saw only the road ahead of him .
        <br/>	
        In front of the cart, a pair of farmers walked along the road. Their tattered pants and bare feet marked them as poor, even for farmers. Their black coats however, made Theo wary. He pulled the blond boy’s hair and whispered, “either stay down in the sacks or come up and sit by me. Either way, no words.” 
        <br/>      
        The boy, knocking his hand against a set of iron calipers, jumped to the front of the car. Theo smiled for a moment after realizing the boy had jammed his fingers in fright, but quickly straightened himself and smoothed all expression off his face. 
        <br/>       
        “Ho, good evening. Could you tell me how far from the next town we are?” Theo asked the farmers while some distance still remained. As he said this he pulled his donkey’s reins to slow the cart.
        <br/>        
        “Evening to yours as well.” Replied the shorter of the two men. “Town is no more than a half hour away, but…” the farmer looks back up the path and then at his companion. The two share knowing looks and seem, to Theo, to be holding an entire conversation in half glances and eyebrow knits.
        <br/>       
        “Well,” the shorter farmer continues, “the town’s in mourning for the night. Elder Cato.” 
        <br/>        
        Theo nods. The farmer’s black coats make sense now. On hearing this, the blonde boy fidgets on the bench. His attention snapped to the farmers, “No way Cato is dead. You aren’t joking are you?”
        <br/>      
        The farmers stood barefoot in the muck and returned the blonde boy’s stare for some time. A summer evening’s breeze brushed past the four on the road, shaking the trees and reminding the two farmers of tomorrow’s work. They turned to continue down the path. 
        <br/>
        Theo shook himself from his mind as they passed. “My grievances for the lost. May he have found some peace. My hopes that he and Salonia may be together again.” He pulled his donkey’s reins and started again towards town.
        <br/>
        “Not tonight.” the taller farmer shouted, turning back towards the wagon. “Stay out of town for the night. You can stay in our fields. Best leave the folks that knew him to him and their own for the night.”
        <br/>
        Theo turned and saw tears in this taller farmer’s eyes. The shorter of the two pulled his friend along. 
        <br/>
        “The fields. We will stay quiet and to ourselves. Thank you,” Theo said. He closed his eyes and bowed his head just a few degrees forward. 
        <br/>
        The blonde boy, seeing Theo’s gesture, mimics it, “Thank you friend,” he said. 
        <br/>
        The short farmer flicked his eyes past the blonde boy like a branch falling from a tree. 
        <br/>
        Theo raised his head and began coxing his donkey to turn the cart about. Amber light solidified the late spring leaves over the wagon team. 
        <br/>
        With their cart turned, Theo and the blonde boy move back south, running their cart through the light ruts they had just carved.
        <br/>
        Wide swaths of purpling sky sat forever behind the pin pricks of the brightest stars. A red dot hung to the north. It is Mars. It watches Meriadoc. 
        <br/>
        The mud from the morning’s rain had begun to dry. Underfoot, Theo’s donkey pulled steadily. Theo could tell he was hungry after the long day’s work. Theo could feel Cato’s wake. Barefeet collapse just dried mud in the town’s center. A woman wearing an official green sash consoles her friend, another woman. The crying friend’s hands, so used to kneading dough, now macerated her bony face. They bruised her cheekbones and blackened her eye sockets. The two women’s feet were freezing. Theo’s donkey pushes through the dried mud. 
        <br/>
        Down the road, the taller farmer sood at a clearing. He had removed his black coat and held it in his hand. It blew in the cold wind. Home for the night.

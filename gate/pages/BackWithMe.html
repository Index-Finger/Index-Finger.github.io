    <p>And the next story begins with, uh, well it begins. I’m sorry, dear listener. I just feel a little, wuh. I just feel a little tired, and huh. It’s that feeling when, uh, hm. What is that exactly? It’s, oh! It’s thirsty! I’m thirsty! Oh, but I have another story to tell. You are sitting there just listening to me babble, you need a story.

        Well, we can start at the beginning where, uh well where there was a chef who baked a, oh I apologize. My mouth is dry, my tongue is like a cotton swab. I feel gross, like really gross. You know, now that I think of it, I haven’t drunk anything all day. I’ll fix this I promise. I… you know. Just yesterday my Uncle dropped some stuff off. Apparently, he had been brewing this stuff for a while. What was it again? It was, oh he has the best beard that man, the best beard, and the worst bald spot. I wish he’d just go bald. Commit to one thing and embrace the future. For a wise old man he sure … root beer! It was root beer.

        Dear listener. I think we are on the cusp of something great here. I just have to get my root beer. I’ll be feeling better in a minute, I’m sure. As I stand up and leave the comfort of my great wingback chair, I leave behind the comfort of the reading room. And, oh, duhh, dark spots bubble up in my sight, obscuring the warm candle glow. My ears swim with warm blood swirling through my vestibular system. I grab onto the padded, winged chair. It’s only just possible to see the winged chair as I grab onto it. My senses slowly return. The sweet and musty smell of the reading room eases me back to consciousness. Root beer, it’s a cure for the spins. Let’s go get some together.

        I walk along with the Persian runner in my slippers and am delivered to the threshold of the hall. As I pass into this dark space the comfortable runner falls away to be replaced by cold tile, the smells and light of the reading room fade, replaced only by the sensation of this dank hallway. The old pipes groan, pop, and, as they are visible in this unfinished hallway, twist. Crumbs of calcium have formed stalactites that hang from the wet pipes. I feel a cold wind pulling me down the hall. I will find the root beer, dear listener, and I will get back to our stories at hand.

        The kitchen is damp. I’ve left the window open and it has rained. Whoops. Either Way, the root beer. I grab a glass from the cabinet and, oh, but there are no clean glasses. That’s fine, I ran the dishwasher earlier. I grab a glass from the now clean dishwasher and, oh, well I forgot to run this. I’ll just hand wash one of these then. My kitchen, lit only by moonlight and the light from the reading room, is disgusting. I am ashamed dear listener.

        As I sit at my lowest point, thirsty, ashamed, a little chilly, holy intervention strikes. The moonlight, coming out from behind a cloud, reflects on a clean glass sitting on the windowsill behind the sink, and blinding me momentarily. Look at that little thing! Pretty sure I just used it to drink water earlier so it's more or less clean. Reaching over to pick it up, the silverlit meadow behind my kitchen reaches for me. Beams of thick moonlight filter through my oak tree's leaves. As I stare, my eyes defocus and blend the lawn into a monotone lake, rippling with weeds and grasses. The lake shifts from silver to blue, deep as a mid-summer sky. Tight ripples hide monotone fauna just under the surface. Joyous creations lap one another, frolicking in a deep ocean millimeters wide. The lake is sepia. Life slows to a crawl. Fish dry out in the sun as it blasts their ocean into the atmosphere. A gigantic trout, just then playing in a coral jungle, rots in an instant, becoming bleached bone, then fades into its jungle. It is an indivisible piece of the background. Dry desert stretches out past me. Dark floaters swirl through my vision. My legs wobble. My feet ache. Thirst. Thirst, I’m back, I, the glass, the root beer!

        I quickly run the glass under hot water. If it burns my skin it probably burns the bacteria. I won’t be using soap today, no. I open the fridge and there it is. A 2-gallon jug, inscribed with a picture of Uncle Ben cheesing, horrible hair and all, drawn by his wife. I pulled his grinning head off the shelf and poured it into my glass. Beautiful, fizzy, brown. I toss back the first glassful in an instant. The over-carbonated soda burns my throat on the way down. My tongue stops sticking to my throat. I suck in a huge breath. Had I forgotten to breathe all this time? I pour another. Tall, fizzy, the sound loud, relieving. I am saved. I drink, I pour another, I drink. And a final glass, for the trip back.

        After putting Uncle Ben back in the fridge, I take one final look around my kitchen. Disgusting. I’ll sort this out later dear listener. I promise. Quick steps take me through the dank hallway with speed. Light from my reading room licks my face and pulls me back. I pass stalactites and popping pipes without further thought and breach the musty chamber. Home at last.

        Almost everyone in Cold Spring is preparing for tomorrow. Few Cold Springers will be sleeping tonight, and school tomorrow has preemptively been called off. The town’s children rejoice; parents are less than thrilled. Lainy, Moira: Are you going to be putting together any witch traps this year?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        No. Those are for kids. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        But you might catch the witches! Do you not want to see what they really look like?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        We tried one last year. We covered ping pong balls in jelly and poured them all over our street. The witches didn’t even go on our street-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Yeah! And then Mom made us clean all the jelly up so it wouldn't attract any animals-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Yeah, that was dumb. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Did you two not have any ideas for new traps to try this year? I heard the Abber twins bought a giant slip and slide. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -No we had ideas-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Yeah they just weren't very good-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -well my idea to draw a giant hole on the ground was pretty good but you didn’t like it-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -That was my idea! Stop lying-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Your idea was pretending to be the witches’ mom and have them kiss you good night-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -oh yeah you’re right. Why didn’t you like that one?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [The rumble of video game controllers suddenly stopped, leaving just the sound of muffled video game music as the two kids stomped up their wooden stairs.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Mom! Can we have the bedsheets?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Click. Click. A cacophonous squeaking of sneakers on the court. A short sharp whistle. Then, a woman’s voice, warm and somewhat corky, fills the gym.]

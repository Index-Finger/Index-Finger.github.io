        [Clanging again. This time, much louder. It is battering and comes a thousand times a second. A dozen folding chairs slide out, and a few clatter to the floor. Bare feet slide into heavy boots and a dozen low voices, each separate but part of some greater will, puppet bodies into heavy suits. The engines, like avalanches, reverberate. Click. Click. The sound of engines remains but is joined by the woosh of accelerated water.]

        It is 79 degrees and humid this Sunday night here in Cold Springs, Ohio. There has been an accident along the Witches Day route. The old mining shaft burst into flames just twenty minutes ago. Firefighters and EMTs are on the scene and working hard to make sure everyone is safe and sound. Three engines are here working this fire, it's a blaze. I see Lawrence working outside. I will not be getting in his way but it is comforting to see him so calm and professional. It looks like the firefighters are pulling people out of the building. That is … Jimmy Lamont! From my year. And Tony Block, also my year. Valentina Rammond, Bryn Strong, King Smoug. It is the innovation club. They look okay. No burns visible from where I am. I hope they’re okay. The mayor just came out of the shaft. Looks like he is okay too. Bryn! Bryn! Bryn. What happened? Are you okay?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Twoppe! I’m okay. I’m okay. Oh my god, I’m okay. We were testing our witch trap and bang you know? Oh my god did that thing pop. We built it in the shaft for the chimney effect. Wanted to use the mountain to breathe fire at the witches when they came through. But man, did that not work. Jesus, I’m okay. They’re all out right? Everyone okay?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Everyone got out without a scratch. You are all safe. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Thank god! Thank god!

        [Corce, jittery laughing slowly fades into the sound of engines and water.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        King! King! Are you all right? What hap-. The sky has just begun to change. It is … 78 degrees and humid this Sunday night here in Cold Spring, Ohio.

        [Labored breathing and heavy footfalls carry the microphone away from the engines and water.]

        The witches have just arrived. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Cheering, shouting, and the occasional firework buzzing.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Mrs. Laroche! Good to see you here. Can you tell me a bit about what you see? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Hello Tewpence. I brought something to throw. It’s my mom’s old necklace. How am I supposed to know when to do it? And sure. It looks like a cloud of green and purple coming from the south. I don’t really see anything yet. How fast do they come through? Those two kids should not be in the middle of the road, should they?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Oh, Lainy and Moira are getting their trap set up. I am excited to see it. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Well beyond them, and there is no way I would let my two kids stand in the middle of the street like that, I can see flashing lights coming from the cloud.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Whack! And an echo.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Was that the witches? That was a hell of a crack. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        It was! They are still a little ways away so it will be hard to hear exactly what they are saying for a little while. Can you tell me about the necklace? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        That was a voice? Yeah, it was just something she wore when she performed. She did stand up after she retired. She constantly laughed during her sets. A jittery, corky laugh. She was constantly laughing at home too. Way more than I ever did. And I’ll see this again when the witches come back?

        Every Witches Day.

        Sounds nice. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [A high-pitched wail shines through the recording. Then, two rolling lines of words, said simultaneously and pronounced cleanly, quiet the crowd. The sounds of the words are English but without meaning. Like two great actors spouting the most incomprehensible Shakespeare.]

        Three laps cooldown. See you all tomorrow! No, the day after tomorrow. Come on, walk with me. What are you asking me? School paper right?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        No this is a recording, not for the paper. I am doing local interviews for Witches Day and I wanted to know what someone who grew up without the holiday thinks of it. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Well, it’s a cute tradition. There aren’t any holidays in the spring normally so it helps bridge that gap.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Oh, it’s not always in the spring.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        What do you mean? Like it's a biannual thing?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        It happens around every 200 days or so actually. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Who decides when it actually happens?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        The witches do. We have just figured out, more or less, when to expect them. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [A corky laugh fills the recording. It comes in short bursts, three at a time.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Who are the witches?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        The- you know about Witches Day right? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Why don’t you tell me a bit and I’ll tell you when we get to the stuff I know.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Every 200 or so days, two witches, one pale green and the other dark purple appear south of town on I-75. They come through the town, slinging hexes and tossing potions. They only ever hit one another. No one is really sure if they are actually fighting or if it’s all choreographed. I like to think they plan it all out in advance beforehand. Anyway, we celebrate every year by watching the witches plow through Center Street. We set traps, tell stories, and throw things to the witches that we want them to keep.

        And this is happening tonight? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Sometime in the next 20 or so hours. It’s hard to know exactly. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        What kinds of things do people give to the witches?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Lots of things. Anything that you are happy not to see for a little while but which you want to be reminded of in the future. Oh and nothing heavy. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Tonight? I’ll swing by.

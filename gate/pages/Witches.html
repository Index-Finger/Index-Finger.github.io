    <p> It is 78 degrees and humid this Sunday morning here in Cold Spring, Ohio. Today is the ides of April and sometime in the next 24 hours, the Witches will come to town. 

        [Tewpence Rosen speaks slowly and deliberately into his leather-wrapped shotgun microphone. He speaks much slower than normal because, as he was once told, he’s a mumbler.]

        Fewer than 2,000 call Cold Spring home. Our small mining village suffered years of economic decline until it discovered a large network of caverns underneath Center Street. The caverns pulled tourists on their way to nearby Mammoth Caves, ensuring a steady stream of pension-based income for the town’s near future.

        30 years ago, Dellwood Coal, the last operating mining company, struck gold. Of course, by that I mean two old men with a bundle of dynamite breached a freshwater aquifer, instantly killing them and flooding the coal mines in the process. Thankfully the cave system, often referred to by locals as the weeping tunnels, was disconnected from the coal mines and suffered no horrible flooding. However, that day, something happened. My Uncle Larz saw it all.

        [Tewpence stands up from his parents' William Morris rug, causing the tape to record shuffling and static. He tugs up the leather case used to hold his recording gear together and kicks open the screen door to the outdoors. He grunts, like he’s a little out of breath, and clicks the microphone off. As, according to the recording tape, no time elapsed, Tewpence immediately clicks the tape back on.]

        Well. One minute, there was nothing at all. And then, the next minute. There they were.

        [A long pause occurs. The microphone picks up Tewpence’s awkward shuffling.]

        Then. They were gone again. Wham! How’s that for your radio show? You’re like a little Bing Crosby with that thing.

        Can you tell the story of when th-?

        I’ve told you about that day a dozen times, Tewpy. It’s a boring story. Everyone knows about it. Why don’t you make a good radio show like War of the Worlds? It literally killed your Aunt, it was so good. Go talk to the new volleyball coach. Her mom died recently. You can get a good sob story.

        [The tape clicks off and the tape clicks back on. The vague sound of video game grunts is muffled by a much louder rumble of video game controllers being rapidly tapped and crunched.]

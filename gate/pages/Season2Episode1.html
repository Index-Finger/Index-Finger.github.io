        A woman with checkered flannel teeth just stuck her gum on the side of a wood paneled booth.
        She offered me a hayride into the middle of town but I declined as I didn’t want to move out of my house
        and home. 
        <br/>
        While chewing on maple sap gum a thought dawned on me, that the glasses I was wearing were
        both crooked and fake. I wore them for the snap snap sound they made when I chewed the gum; the gum I
        chewed which made me anxious enough to chew maple sap gum.
        <br/>
        Instead I found a pile of boots under a floor board. The boards, much too long as they were,
        seemed entirely too short to withstand the lengths of my investigations. I never saw the gum again,
        instead all I saw was a checkered woman. Also a man looking to sell me his shoes. All left.
        <br/>
        The gum was stuck in my mouth. The floor boards were underneath me. The glasses remained on my
        face. The right boots were in my house already. I’m glad house and home have never lost me.
        <br/>
        The next day the sun shone on me. Reflected off my glasses, it stabbed into my eyes and through
        me, out the back of my head, and painted a dirty Gauguin on my back wall. It’s my house and home
        though. I got up and the light moved but the fresco stayed, stained in the wall.
        <br/>
        My teeth were painted by my toothbrush, the same checkered flannel color they always are. My
        soon to be husband skipped buckshot off a rock and into my eye. The rock was so flat and clean that it
        skipped 7 times before falling off into the pond. The ripples almost tore my face apart.
        The glasses are gone. The gum is gone. My teeth are painted, and I am in my house and my
        home.

    <p>Hello. Thank you for peeking into my book. For the purposes of the next half an hour or so I would like you to imagine me reading to you. To help place that image, you can imagine me wearing a large pair of khaki sweatpants and seated in my large wingback chair. I often fall asleep here but I promise, I will remain wide awake for these next 30 minutes. My room is painted, and covered in amateur paintings. Some are done by me, some by people that I love. There are books and clothes all over, not because I am not neat enough to put them away, but because they are tired of being in transit and have decided to take a rest.</p>

    <p id=>They say that there are only 7 stories out there. I don’t know about that sort of thing. That has always felt like saying sentences are so basic because, at their core, they are all the same. A SUBJECT modifies an OBJECT with a VERB. Larry kicks Billy. I ride my bike. Spot likes Dot. There is only “one” sentence but each sentence is different. I think stories are similar. The basic structure of a story tells you nothing about that story. Only in the most factory devised stories will structure perfectly line up with a prescribed plan. Structures like this mean nothing. A story is made by blending the familiar and the unfamiliar. We begin with unfamiliar characters living a relatable existence. Once these characters become familiar, the author lets them move into a new world. Beginning a large fantasy novel by explaining all of the lore of the land is difficult and often uninteresting. Instead, begin with a character and their home. “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole [...] it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.” Middle Earth is filled with tremendously unfamiliar sights, people, and places. Tolkien knew his readers would understand a private, comfortable abode and, by extension, any character who inhabits it. Often, this blending is also piece-wise. Once we know the character of Bilbo Tolkien removes the familiarity of the Shire and replaces it with troll camps, underground lakes, and elvish fortresses. Through it all, we have Bilbo as an emblem of familiarity and comfort to hold onto. Explicit characters and locations aren’t the only things that are familiar or unfamiliar. In The Fifth Season, N.K. Jemisin uses the familiarity of family relationships, trauma, and longing to associate us with the main characters and world, eventually allowing us also to more explicitly interact with the abstracted discrimination affecting both The Still and our world.</p>

    <p>Wow!</p>

    <p>Sorry about that. It was a bit much. All of that is to say, I think the best stories are a little of something new, and a little of something old. Now, no more theory! Just listen a while while I read you these stories. Remember, I’ll sit right here in my faded red wingback chair while you sit in your seat of choice. I hope you enjoy.</p>

    <p>This first one is about a package. Sent from, well, who knows where, but arriving in the arms of <a href="LostPackage.html">Rachel Panow… </a></p>

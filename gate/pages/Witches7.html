        [A high-pitched wail shines through the recording. Then, two rolling lines of words, said simultaneously and pronounced cleanly, quiet the crowd. The sounds of the words are English but without meaning. Like two great actors spouting the most incomprehensible Shakespeare.]

        Well, I’m seeing them now, the witches. They're coming through fast aren’t they, my god! Yellow and blue and purple and marble? Sorry, I mean, all of those colors are coming off of them. It looks like they’re grappling with one another, throwing each other down and up and on the ground! Oh my god, the kids! You’re sure they’ll be alright? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Watch! They will be absolutely fine. I think this is their best idea yet. Oh, throw the necklace now! 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        What are they doing? Why are they dressed as ghosts? What’s coming off of the witches? Are those shoes?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        They are returning all of the gifts we gave them. Oh, here they go!
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Over the recording, two kids are singing something. As their song goes along, they become more sure of themselves and sing louder.]

        Witchies, Witchies, comie here. 
        Gimmie, your mommy, a kiss on the ear. 
        Witchies, Witchies, quickly now.
        Or we’ll turn to a big old cow.
        Witchies, Witchies, kissies please, 
        It’s time for your old mom to go to bed!
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        They’re about to be hit!
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [A beautiful cackle. Long and salty.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        The witches zoomed just around the twins and blew them simultaneous kisses. I cannot believe these two. Their traps always seem to work.

        [A tremendous woosh and gush comes out of the blue.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        What happened to the street? There’s water gushing out of the sewers! It’s filling up the streets! 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Hiss.] 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        The water flowed back to the mine! It looks like it helped to put the fire out. Wow, there is a lot of steam coming off of that thing. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [As the sound of the witches dies away, only flowing water can be heard. Soon, footsteps and a smattering of chat. Then, the cracking of aluminum cans, the popping of fireworks, and laughing. Click.]

        [Click.]

        [Click. Click. A low, warm buzz. Many low voices talk loudly about chili in the background.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -ew questions for a recording I am doing about Witches Day?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Tewpence, hey. Good to see you. How’s your dad? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -He is well. I do not think he wants to see you after last Saturday though. Maybe steer clear of the block for a little while. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Heard. Why are you asking questions about Witches' Day?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -I want to hear what Cold Springers have to say about it. I want to be able to show others and, you know, I never really spoke with anyone seriously about it before today. It feels like we are all clouds arranged in a beautiful sky every Witches Day. To the onlooker, it appears that we have all been carefully arranged. We look beautiful as a composition but no one took the time to arrange us. Who came up with the Witches Day celebrations and what aspects of it are important to people?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Oh well… so you want like, what I feel about the whole thing?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [A low voice shouts, and a series of clangs ring out over the warm buzz.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Oh, Chili's ready. Want some? 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -No thanks, Lawrence. Mom made some Catfish Po Boys earlier. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Mind if I answer your questions at the table?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [The low voices get louder. They are still all talking about chili and the merits of it being hot or mild.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Witches Day is always busy for us. Funnily enough, Tom did some data crunching and found out that Witches Day always has one of the lowest death rates of the year. Mayor Perulo has us out in force, and there are always a few kids with twisted ankles from falling off of witch trap ladders and down wolf holes but, yeah, it’s a bit of a holiday for us because of that. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [A higher voice calls from beyond the clanging and the low hum.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Lawrence set up this chili contest to celebrate. You should let him eat the goods. He’s gotta judge the thing.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Thanks, Lainy. Look Tewpence. We’ve been having so many more overdoses in the past few years. The town’s aging population is in poor health; so many of them worked in the silver plants. It’s nice that even if it is a fluke, to think that there is a day every year that we get a break. And a break for a reason.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Do you think the witches have anything to do with the low death rate?
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Well…
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Clanging drowns the microphone. Then, dozens of pieces of metal on ceramic.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Oh, that is good Gadot. Do I think the witches have anything to do with the death rate? Yes and no. The witches don’t do anything to us. For as loud and bright as they are, I have never seen, never even heard of any healing magic done by the witches. No injuries were caused by the twisted sisters either. I think, especially for those in bad health… Well.
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [The clanging stops and the low hum is joined only by the sound of ceramic clacking, folding chairs shifting, and feet shuffling across concrete floor.]
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        Feeling a shift in the mood of those around you is strong. It can give life to people who have very little left. It’s fleeting but, for a day or two, the change in routines, the sudden comings and goings, the preparations, and the excitement, it can give a little life to whoever needs it most. The witches don’t do anything to heal people. But the holiday props people up a bit. It gives everyone something easy to focus on. 
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        -Thank you, Lawrence. I should be getting to my mom’s house fo-
        <p id="breaker"> </p>
        [Clanging again. This time, much louder. It is battering and comes a thousand times a second. A dozen folding chairs slide out, and a few clatter to the floor. Bare feet slide into heavy boots and a dozen low voices, each separate but part of some greater will, puppet bodies into heavy suits. The engines, like avalanches, reverberate. Click. Click. The sound of engines remains but is joined by the woosh of accelerated water.]

    <p id="hello">Hi! Welcome to my website. Eventually, I want this site to be a hub for some hypertext fiction. While I work on writing that I've added a few fun pages you can look through. Hopefully you will also see a "fiction" tab. There may not be much in it now, but that's a sneak peak into the future! </p>

        <li>How about some ambiance? <a href="pages/ambiance.html"><img class="icon" src="images/download.jpg"></a></li>
        <li>A couple of design pages I'll be working on. For how a site could look.<a href="pages/testsites.html"><img class="icon" src="images/download.jpg"></a></li>
